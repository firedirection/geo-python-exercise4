    "# Exercise 4: Classifying and converting temperatures\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand how to use functions in Python.\n",
    "In this week's exercise you are asked to create a simple tool that converts temperatures from\n",
    "one temperature-type to another and then classify those temperatures into specific temperature classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After making your changes, you will need to upload your files to GitHub.\n",
    "The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where asked or at the end of this document in the [section titled Answers](#answers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exercise 4 is due by the start of lecture on 3.10.**\n",
    "- Don't forget to check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python.github.io/2018/lessons/L4/exercise-4-hints.html) if you're having trouble.\n",

    "## Problem 0 - Mid-term course feedback requested\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you get started on the exercise, we'd like for you to take 5 minutes to provide us with some feedback on how the course is going so far.\n",
    "This is the second time we're teaching the course in this format, and we would be very pleased to have your honest thoughts (positive or negative) about how things are going.\n",

    "In the first problem your aim is to create a function that converts the input temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. Follow closely the instructions and use **exactly** the same variable, function, and parameter names as stated in the instructions because we use automatic grading to check your codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should do following (criteria for grading), :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create a function called `fahr_to_celsius` \n",
    "\n",
    "  - The function should have one input parameter called `temp_fahrenheit`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Inside the function, create a variable called `converted_temp` to which you should assign the conversion result (i.e., the input Fahrenheit temperature converted to Celsius)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The conversion formula from Fahrenheit to Celsius is:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/Fahrenheit_to_Celsius_formula.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Return the converted value from the function back to the user\n",
    "  - Comment your code and add a docstring that explains how to use your `fahr_to_celsius` function (i.e., you should write the purpose of the function, parameters, and returned values)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Upload and commit your code into your own GitHub repository for Exercise 4\n",
