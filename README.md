# Exercise 4: Classifying and converting temperatures

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand how to use functions in Python.
In this week's exercise you are asked to create a simple tool that converts temperatures from
one temperature-type to another and then classify those temperatures into specific temperature classes.

After making your changes, you will need to upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where asked or at the end of this document in the [section titled Answers](#answers).

- **Exercise 4 is due by the start of lecture on 3.10.**

## Problem 0 - Mid-term course feedback requested

Before you get started on the exercise, we'd like for you to take 5 minutes to provide us with some feedback on how the course is going so far.
This is the second time we're teaching the course in this format, and we would be very pleased to have your honest thoughts (positive or negative) about how things are going.
Feedback is **completely anonymous**.

## Problem 1 - Simple temperature calculator (6 points)

In the first problem your aim is to create a function that converts the input temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. Follow closely the instructions and use **exactly** the same variable, function, and parameter names as stated in the instructions because we use automatic grading to check your codes.

**Start Problem 1 by cloning this repo to cloud computer and opening the following notebook**:
