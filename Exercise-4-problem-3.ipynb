    " 1. Read in the data from the data cell (execute it) and iterate over the Fahrenheit temperatures.\n",
    " 2. Convert the Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius using your `fahr_to_celsius` function from that was created in Problem 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "**This problem contains two parts**. In part 1, you should do following (part 2 continues below):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Create a new **script** -file called `temp_functions.py` into your `exercise-4-username` directory as we saw in Lesson 4 materials. Copy and paste the functions that you wrote in Problem 1 and Problem 2, into that script file (i.e. functions `fahrt_to_celsius` and `temp_classifier`).\n",
    " - Save the script file (CNTRL + S), and continue working on **this** Notebook (i.e. `Exercise-4-problem-3.ipynb`).\n",
